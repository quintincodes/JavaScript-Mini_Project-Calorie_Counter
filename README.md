# Mini Project: Calorie Counter

## Description

This **JavaScript-based project** is a calorie tracking application designed to help users manage their daily caloric intake and expenditure. Users can set a daily calorie budget, add entries for meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), and log exercises to calculate the remaining calories. The application dynamically updates the calorie count and provides feedback on whether the user is in a surplus or deficit.
